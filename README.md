# goshawkjs

GoshawkJS is a javascript client for goshawk.

## Getting Started

Run a goshawk server with the parameter `--wssPort 9999`.

Make sure your browser has the certificates.  You can test this by going to https://localhost:9999/ws.  
If it's working, it will say 'Bad Request' and you'll see that a connection occurred in the
goshawk console.
